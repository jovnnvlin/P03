        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I currently serve as the Visual Designer at Precision NanoSystems, a biotechnology company in Vancouver. In my role at Precision NanoSystems, I specialize in creating a wide range of digital and print materials, encompassing user guides, brochures, application notes, scientific posters, PowerPoint presentations, packaging, banners, website layouts, and various graphics. I play a pivotal role in maintaining the companyâ€™s visual branding, making me the go-to resource for all matters related to our visual identity.</p>
            <p>In addition to my core responsibilities, I actively engage in training, mentoring, and overseeing graphic design interns. My journey in the world of design is further enriched by my academic pursuits, as I am an Interactive Arts & Technology student with a concentration in media arts and a minor in publishing at Simon Fraser University.</p>
